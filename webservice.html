					    <p>PHP website development is an example of web development. A website is the basic element of all 
					    activities that we see on the Internet. To accomplish any task over the Internet, the very first thing 
					    we need to do is visit the appropriate website. Static websites are there to provide information only. 
					    So, the primary goal of a static website can be accomplished by the use designing technologies like HTML 
					    and CSS only. But if there is some needs of programming or logic behind the working procedure of the 
					    website, then it becomes necessary to use a programming or scripting language. In PHP web application 
					    development, the language PHP is used.</p>
					    <p>PHP development services are named like this because they use PHP as their medium of putting some logic 
					    in the website. PHP is the abbreviation, for brevity's sake, of Hypertext Preprocessor. As it is hinted 
					    above, PHP is a language. Programs or codes written in PHP get executed on the server. PHP is termed as 
					    a scripting language and not a programming language. That is why, perhaps, PHP is primarily used in PHP 
					    web development services. PHP can be viewed as a competitor of similar server-side scripting languages, 
					    like ASP and JSP. Desirable application performance can be provided by this technology.</p>
